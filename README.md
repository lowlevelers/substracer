# Substrate Simulator
## Description
Simulate the substrate network in an interactive graphical interface.
- Run a virtual Substrate node directly on the browser
- Configure pallets and chain specification interactively
- Tracing the peer-to-peer network behavior
## Motivation
One of the biggest obstacles to diving deeper into the Polkadot blockchain is the limitation of hardware requirements and lack of interactive approaches. The learning curve is huge to start with the Polkadot core technologies and requires much time to read the documentation. Inspired by this [thread](https://forum.polkadot.network/t/9-ideas-for-the-decentralized-future-of-polkadot/4731) on Polkadot forum, there is no unified approach for DevRel to widespread the value of the whole Polkadot ecosystem.

Hence, we feel like the community needs a more creative solution to the stated problem. With experience in traditional networking software, the `Cisco Packet Tracker` is a tool hugely inspires the birth of the `Substrate Simulator`.
